> I’ve chosen Vue for this project for several reasons. Although any option (Angular, React or Vue) would be excellent for web development, Vue has a novelty character into it, and the ever-growing attention it has been attracting from the tech community is about to explode. It already enjoys from an important impact worldwide and a supportive community (has been the hottest project of 2017 on GitHub reaching more than 40k stars https://risingstars.js.org/2017/en/#section-all).

>Even though it hasn’t been developed by a well-established company (React-Facebook and Angular-Google), a lot of companies are transitioning into Vue, especially in the Chinese market where “the big three” tech-companies have adopted it (Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent), among many. Also, it is being used by one of the most successful PHP frameworks (Laravel). 

>Furthermore, on the technical side of things, I reckon that it actually brings effectiveness to the codding process: this MVC framework is beginner friendly, powerful, provided with great documentation, easy to setup and has a great performance due to its light code weight (which will make things easier for any kind of browser in any kind of device). Plus, the fact of including the template, scripts and style of a component in a single file makes things easier for maintaining, fixing and upgrading a website. Thanks to third-party solutions, the functionality of Vue can easily be extended since it is designed to be incrementally adoptable. Also, there is no need to learn new languages, as it is pure Javascript.

>In short, Vue has learnt from Angular and React experience, allowing the developer to achieve the same results but in a simpler way.
